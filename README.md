# What
This is just me beginning a journey into learning some quantum computing.  I'm not sure how far I will go
It will definitely be an uphill journey.  I will need to learn some math along the way, linear algrebra for sure.  Looks like some stats maybe.
Either way, all stuff I don't know, and will need to learn along they way.  Coding helps me slow down and think about probelms.  So I will do that here, though may switch over to notes, or what not as the learning takes me.


This feels like a worthwhile journey to begin.  Let us see where we end.
